    "question": "Higher returns from international markets?",
    "human_text": "Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile -- higher risk trades off against higher return potential, always. The better reason for having some money in that area is that, as with bonds, it moves out-of-sync with the US markets and once you pick your preferred distribution, maintaining that balance semi-automatically takes advantage of that to improve your return-vs-risk position. I have a few percent of my total investments in an international stock index fund, and a few percent in an international REIT, both being fairly low-fee. (Low fees mean more of the money reaches you, and seems to be one of the better reasons for preferring one fund over another following the same segment of the market.) They're there because the model my investment advisor uses -- and validated with monte-carlo simulation of my specific mix -- shows that keeping them in the mix at this low level is likely to result in a better long-term outcome than if i left them out. No guarantees, but probabilities lean toward this specfic mix doing what i need. I don't pretend to be able to justify that via theory or to explain why these specific ratios work... but I understand enough about the process to trust that they are on (perhaps of many) reasonable solutions to get the best odds given my specific risk tolerance, timeline, and distaste for actively managing my money more than a few times a year. If that.",
    "ai_text": "It is possible that international markets may offer higher returns compared to domestic markets. There are a number of factors that can contribute to this, including differences in economic growth rates, interest rates, and political environments. However, investing in international markets also comes with additional risks, such as currency exchange rate fluctuations and potential political instability. It is important for investors to carefully consider these risks and perform due diligence before making any investment decisions. It may be advisable to consult with a financial advisor or professional to determine if international investing is appropriate for your individual circumstances and risk tolerance.",

    "human_text": "i when i was 13 or 14 i shaved two patches on my legs . one on each thigh . , to see how long it would take to grow back . they are still there . i m 21 now .",
    "ai_text": "All hair on your body grows at a different rate. The hair on your head typically grows faster than the hair on your legs. That's why it might seem like your leg hair isn't growing as much.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the length of your hair is determined by how long your hair grows before it falls out. This process is called the hair growth cycle. The hair on your legs might have a longer growth cycle, which means it takes longer for new hair to grow in and replace the hair that has fallen out.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible that you just don't have as much hair on your legs as you do on your head or face. Everyone's hair growth is different, and it's completely normal for some people to have less hair on certain parts of their body.",

    "human_text": "Hi ThereThere is no interaction between both the drugs as they are routinely used in cardiac patients.However lisinopril could be the reason of your symptoms as you are taking a high dose of it. I would like to suggest you to reduce the dose of it to half for a week while monitoring your bp. If your BP remains stable for a week after reducing the dose then continue with low dose.I wish you good health",
    "ai_text": "It is generally not recommended to take aspirin and Lispernol together without medical supervision. Aspirin and Lispernol belong to different classes of medications and they may have potential drug interactions when taken together. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and Lispernol is a beta blocker. Beta blockers, like Lispernol, are commonly used to treat high blood pressure and other heart conditions. They work by blocking the effects of certain hormones and chemicals in the body that can constrict blood vessels and increase blood pressure.\n\nAspirin may interfere with the effectiveness of Lispernol in lowering blood pressure. Additionally, taking aspirin and Lispernol together may increase the risk of bleeding and other side effects.\n\nIt is important to discuss any concerns about your medication regimen with your healthcare provider. They will be able to advise you on the best course of treatment based on your specific situation and medical history. They may recommend alternative medications or adjust the dosages of your current medications to minimize the risk of interactions and side effects. Do not make any changes to your medication regimen without consulting your healthcare provider.",

Some people believe that a diet that is high in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains is the best choice, while others believe that a diet that includes more meat and dairy products is better. \nOverall, it's important for people to eat a variety of different types of foods, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and protein sources, and to pay attention to their bodies to see how different foods make them feel.

    "ai_text": "Pressing your tongue against the roof of your mouth and your finger between your eyebrows is a technique called the \"pressure point\" method. It is a simple and natural way to try to relieve congestion and a stuffy nose.\r\n\r\nWhen you press your tongue against the roof of your mouth and your finger between your eyebrows, it stimulates certain pressure points in your face and head. These pressure points are thought to be connected to the sinuses and nasal passages, which can help to clear out mucus and relieve congestion.\r\n\r\nWhile this technique may work for some people, it is not a proven scientific method for relieving congestion. Some people find it helpful, while others do not. It is always a good idea to talk to a doctor if you are experiencing persistent or severe congestion.

It is not uncommon for the President's approval ratings to increase during a national crisis, as Americans tend to rally around the leader of their country in times of emergency. In this particular case, President Bush was widely perceived as having handled the situation effectively, and many Americans may have felt a sense of patriotism and national pride in the wake of the attacks.

I've had two teeth extracted this week and have been told to use hot salty water to aid the healing process, i can't do this as the pain is excruciating and salt aggrevates even more. I also have a cold sore on my lip. What do you think is the cause of the sore palate at the roof of my mouth & are there any home remedies or cures or something i can buy over the counter?",
    "ai_text": "Yes, a sore palate (the roof of the mouth) can be a result of post nasal drip. Post nasal drip is a condition in which mucus from the sinuses drains down the back of the throat, often causing irritation and inflammation. This can lead to a sore palate, as well as other symptoms such as a sore throat, cough, and congestion.\n\nPseudoephedrine is a medication that can help to alleviate symptoms of post nasal drip by narrowing the blood vessels in the nasal passages and reducing inflammation. It is often used in combination with other medications to relieve symptoms of sinusitis, allergies, and the common cold. However, it is important to note that pseudoephedrine can have side effects and may not be suitable for everyone.

    "human_text": "Flat roofing is cheaper to build , is accessible ( you can go up on it and do stuff up there more easily , including maintenance and are unlikely to fall ) , and you can add another floor more easily if you want to . Providing you have a decent membrane on there and it does n't need much maintenance , it will be cheaper in the longer run than a pitched roof , and gives you more options .",
    "ai_text": "Malls and businesses often don't have peaked roofs because peaked roofs are more expensive to build than flat roofs. Flat roofs are easier to construct and require less materials, so they are less expensive to build. Flat roofs are also easier to maintain because they don't have as many parts that need to be checked and repaired.\n\nPeaked roofs can be more prone to problems like collapsing under the weight of heavy snow because they have a steeper slope, which means that the snow can pile up more easily. Flat roofs are less likely to have this problem because the snow doesn't have as far to slide before it falls off the edge of the roof. However, flat roofs can still have problems if they are not built or maintained properly, so it's important for businesses to make sure their roofs are in good condition.\n\nIn general, the choice of whether to use a peaked roof or a flat roof for a building is based on a combination of factors, including the cost of construction, the climate where the building is located, and the specific needs of the building.",

Electrical devices started off big and hard to move , and people did n't travel much anyway , so nobody really wanted to carry electrical things with them from country to country , and there was no real need to all use the same format .",
    "ai_text": "Different countries have different types of outlets and plugs because they use different electrical systems, which can vary in terms of the voltage and frequency of the electricity they use. The voltage is the strength of the electrical current, and the frequency is how fast the electricity alternates between positive and negative. Different countries use different voltages and frequencies, so they have developed different outlets and plugs that are compatible with their electrical systems.\n\nFor example, some countries use a voltage of 110-120 volts and a frequency of 60 Hz, while other countries use a voltage of 220-240 volts and a frequency of 50 Hz. If you try to use an appliance from one country in an outlet from another country that has a different voltage or frequency, the appliance may not work properly or may even be damaged.\n\nTherefore, it's important to use the correct adaptor when traveling to a different country to ensure that your appliances will work safely and properly.",

These laws are in place to protect the intellectual property rights of the creators and owners of this material, and to ensure that they are compensated for the use of their work. \nThe fines for piracy are often high because the unauthorized use of copyrighted material can cause significant financial harm to the creators and owners. When someone downloads or shares pirated material, they are taking away the opportunity for the owner to sell that material and earn money from it. This can result in lost sales and revenue for the owner. \nIn addition to the financial harm that piracy causes, it can also have negative effects on the overall economy. When pirated material is widely available, it can be difficult for creators and owners to earn a living from their work, which can discourage innovation and creativity. \nOverall, the fines for piracy are intended to deter people from engaging in this illegal activity, and to compensate the creators and owners for the harm that has been caused.",

Additionally, zebras are found in the wild in Africa, while horses were domesticated by humans thousands of years ago and are now found all over the world.

These islands are valuable because they may have resources like oil and natural gas that could be mined, and they also have strategic military importance. For example, some of the islands have harbors or airports that could be used by military ships or planes.China has a very strong claim to many of the islands in the South China Sea and has been building military bases and other facilities on some of them. This has caused tension with other countries that also claim the islands, and there have been disputes and even military confrontations over the islands in the past.It is not clear whether China would be willing to go to war with the United States over the islands in the South China Sea, as war is usually a very costly and risky endeavor. However, China may be willing to use other means, such as economic or diplomatic pressure, to try to protect its interests in the South China Sea.",

It is calculated by taking the average of the log returns of the stock over the period of time being considered.Log returns are used in finance as a way to normalize the returns of a stock, which can be useful when comparing the performance of stocks with different prices or when comparing the performance of stocks over different time periods. The use of log returns also helps to eliminate the effects of compounding, which can make it easier to compare the returns of different investments.The average log return can be positive or negative, depending on whether the stock has generally increased or decreased in price over the given time period. A positive average log return indicates that the stock has generally increased in price, while a negative average log return indicates that the stock has generally decreased in price. The magnitude of the average log return can also provide information about the volatility of the stock's price movements over the given time period.",

    "ai_text": "Cortisone injections are a type of medication that is used to reduce inflammation and pain in a specific area of the body. When a person has an injury, such as a muscle or cartilage tear, the body's natural response is to send inflammation to the area to help it heal. This inflammation can cause swelling, redness, and pain. Cortisone injections can help reduce these symptoms by decreasing the amount of inflammation in the area.\r\n\r\nTo give a cortisone injection, a healthcare provider will numb the area with a local anesthetic and then use a very thin needle to inject the medication into the injured area. The cortisone works by blocking certain chemicals in the body that cause inflammation. This can help reduce swelling, redness, and pain, and can also help the injury heal faster.\r\n\r\nCortisone injections are usually only used for a short period of time, and are not intended to be a long-term solution for managing pain or inflammation. They can be helpful for people who are experiencing severe pain or inflammation that is not responding to other types of treatment. However, cortisone injections are not suitable for everyone, and a healthcare provider will carefully consider whether they are appropriate for a particular patient based on their individual circumstances.",

Most infants begin to pull themselves up to a standing position around 9-12 months of age and can stand unsupported around 12-15 months of age. However, every child is different and some may develop these skills earlier or later than others.\n\nThere are several factors that can affect an infant's ability to support their own weight and stand upright. These include muscle strength and coordination, balance, and overall physical development. Infants also need to learn how to use their muscles to control their movements and maintain their balance.\n\nIf your daughter is 9 months old and is having difficulty supporting her own weight and standing upright, it is possible that she simply needs more time to develop the necessary muscle strength and coordination. Encourage her to practice standing and moving around, but always supervise her to ensure that she is safe.

    "ai_text": "Sure! When water boils in a vacuum chamber, it's actually boiling at a lower temperature than it would in normal atmospheric pressure. This is because the pressure inside the vacuum chamber is lower than the atmospheric pressure outside of it.Normally, when water boils, the steam that is produced rises up and escapes into the air. But in a vacuum chamber, there is no air for the steam to escape into, so it stays in the chamber with the water. This causes the pressure inside the chamber to increase slightly, which makes it easier for the water to boil.As the water boils, it turns into steam and releases heat energy into the vacuum chamber. This can make the chamber feel warm to the touch. However, the steam is also taking heat away from the water as it boils, which can make the remaining water feel colder.So, in a vacuum chamber, water can boil and get colder at the same time because the low pressure and lack of air allows it to boil at a lower temperature, but the process of boiling also removes heat from the water, making it feel colder.",

Meteorologists can predict heat waves by monitoring the movement of high and low pressure systems and analyzing temperature and humidity data. They can also use computer models to help them forecast the weather.",

    "question": "What did sex workers do before there was contraception ? Sex work is ancient , but condoms were only invented in the 1800s . Did sex workers just get pregnant all the time ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_text": "Contraceptives actually go back thousands of years but they were n't as effective as modern birth control pills or condoms . They used primitive contraceptives but they also become pregnant frequently and STDs were very common .",
    "ai_text": "Sex work is indeed a very old profession, and people have been engaging in it for many centuries. Before the invention of modern contraception, it was more common for people, including sex workers, to get pregnant more often. There were also a number of other methods that people used to try to prevent pregnancy, such as using herbs and other natural substances, but these methods were often unreliable. \nOne way that sex workers in the past may have tried to prevent pregnancy was by using physical barriers, such as cloth or animal skin condoms, which have been used for centuries. However, these methods were also not very effective at preventing pregnancy. \nIt's important to note that sex work is a complex and often stigmatized profession, and the experiences of sex workers throughout history have varied greatly. Some sex workers may have had more options for preventing pregnancy than others, depending on their circumstances and the time and place in which they lived.",

    "question": "Personal credit card for business expenses",
    "human_text": "If you are just starting out, I would say there is no disadvantage to using a personal card for business expenses. In fact, the advantage of doing so is that the consumer protections are better on personal cards than on business cards.  One possible advantage to business credit cards, is that many (but not all) will not show up on your personal credit report unless you default. This might help with average age of accounts if you have a thin credit file, but otherwise it won't make much difference. Issuers also expect higher charge volumes on business cards, so as your business grows might question a lot of heavy charges on a personal card. Whether this would ever happen is speculation, but it's worth being aware of it.",
    "ai_text": "Using a personal credit card for business expenses can be a convenient way to pay for business-related purchases, especially if you don't have a separate business credit card or if you need to make a purchase quickly. However, there are a few things you should consider before using a personal credit card for business expenses:Interest rates: Personal credit cards often have higher interest rates than business credit cards, so you could end up paying more in interest if you carry a balance on your personal card.Credit utilization: Using a personal credit card for business expenses can affect your credit utilization ratio, which is the amount of credit you're using compared to the amount you have available. A high credit utilization ratio can negatively impact your credit score.Record-keeping: It can be more difficult to keep track of business expenses when you're using a personal credit card, as you'll need to separate your personal and business purchases. This can make it harder to accurately track your business expenses for tax purposes.Liability: If you use a personal credit card for business expenses, you may be personally liable for any unpaid balances or debts incurred by your business.Overall, using a personal credit card for business expenses can be a convenient option, but it's important to weigh the pros and cons and consider whether a business credit card might be a better option for your needs.",

    "question": "Why do I always need a blanket to sleep even though it 's hot as hell ? Edit : Thanks for the responses was just curious if other people had the same experience Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_text": "Its because your body feels most cofortable when the temperatre around your body is constant whether or not your body is hot or cold . Having a blanket evens the temperature over your whole body .",
    "ai_text": "It's completely normal to want to use a blanket, even when it's hot outside. The reason for this is that blankets serve a few different purposes that can make us feel more comfortable and help us sleep better. One reason people use blankets when it's hot is because they can help regulate our body temperature. Even though it may be hot outside, the air inside your bedroom may not be as warm, which can make you feel cold. A blanket can help keep you warm and comfortable by trapping your body heat and keeping it close to you. Another reason people use blankets is for comfort. Wrapping yourself in a cozy blanket can make you feel more secure and relaxed, which can help you fall asleep more easily. Finally, some people use blankets for the simple reason that they've always used them and have become accustomed to having one. It may just be a habit or part of their bedtime routine that helps them feel more at ease and ready for sleep. In short, there are many reasons why people use blankets, even when it's hot outside. Whether it's to regulate their body temperature, feel more comfortable, or simply out of habit, blankets can be an important part of getting a good night's sleep.",

    "question": "Where does money come from And who do the money makers give the money to . The banks . The government . The schools . The workers . Please help . Preferably USA answers Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_text": "Money is printed by the US Bureau of Printing and Engraving . It is then purchased by banks who have an account with the Federal Reserve . Money they are given is deducted from their account . But they also send money back all the time , which is added to their account . This cycles the money so that old bills are replaced with fresh bills . Dollar bills have a lifespan of about 2 years so the majority of bills the US prints are to replace old ones .",
    "ai_text": "In the United States, money is created by the federal government and is distributed through the Federal Reserve System, which is the central banking system of the United States.The federal government creates new money in a few different ways. One way is by printing paper money, like dollar bills. The government also creates new money by adding new deposits to the accounts that banks have at the Federal Reserve.The Federal Reserve then distributes this new money to banks, which can then lend it out to people and businesses that need it. When people and businesses borrow money from a bank, they receive the money in the form of a check, electronic transfer, or cash. They can then use this money to make purchases, pay bills, or invest in their businesses.The banks, in turn, receive the money back when the borrower repays the loan, plus interest. The interest is a fee that the borrower pays the bank for borrowing the money.The government also uses some of the money it creates to pay for things like schools, roads, and other public services. The government gets this money by collecting taxes from people and businesses.I hope this helps to explain where money comes from and how it is distributed!",

    "question": "How is the volume of highly complicated 3D bodies calculated ? Bodies that are highly irregular , odd patterns of many other bodies , bodies with weird surfaces , and so on . Explain like I'm five.",
    "human_text": "There are a couple of clever ways . A simple one is to have a container of water of known volume , submerge the mystery object , and then see how much the water level increases .",
    "ai_text": "\\nTo calculate the volume of a highly complicated 3D body, you can use a method called \"water displacement.\" This involves filling a container with water and then carefully placing the 3D body into the water. The water will rise and displace an amount of water equal to the volume of the 3D body. You can then measure the amount of water that has been displaced and use that to calculate the volume of the 3D body.\\n\\nFor example, let's say you have a 3D body that is shaped like a pyramid. You can fill a container with water, and then carefully place the pyramid into the water. The water will rise, and you can measure how much it has risen. Let's say the water has risen by 1 liter. This means that the volume of the pyramid is 1 liter.\\n\\nAnother method for calculating the volume of a 3D body is to divide the body into smaller, regular-shaped pieces (such as cubes or spheres), and then calculate the volume of each piece separately. You can then add up the volumes of all of the pieces to get the total volume of the 3D body. This method can be especially useful for highly complicated 3D bodies that are difficult to measure using the water displacement method.\\n\\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

    "question": "Can a company charge you for services never requested or received?",
    "human_text": "Here's another example of such a practice and the problem it caused.  My brother, who lived alone, was missing from work for several days so a co-worker went to his home to search for him and called the local Sheriff's Office for assistance.  The local fire department which runs the EMS ambulance was also dispatched in the event there was a medical emergency.  They discovered my brother had passed away inside his home and had obviously been dead for days.  As our family worked on probate matters to settle his estate following this death, it was learned that the local fire department had levied a bill against my brother's estate for $800 for responding with their ambulance to his home that day.  I tried to talk to their commander about this, insisting my brother had not called them, nor had they transported him or even checked his pulse.  The commander insisted theirs was common practice - that someone was always billed for their medical response.  He would not withdraw his bill for \"services\".  I hate to say, but the family paid the bill in order to prevent delay of his probate issues and from receiving monies that paid for his final expenses.",
    "ai_text": "It is generally not legal for a company to charge you for services that you have not requested or received. In most cases, a company is required to obtain your consent before charging you for any goods or services. This means that the company must clearly explain to you what they are offering and the associated costs, and you must agree to those terms before the company is allowed to charge you. If a company charges you for services that you did not request or receive, you may be entitled to a refund and could potentially pursue legal action. It is important to carefully review any contracts or agreements that you enter into with a company, and to carefully review your bills and invoices to ensure that you are not being charged for anything that you did not agree to. If you have any concerns about charges that you have received, it is a good idea to contact the company and try to resolve the issue amicably. If you are unable to resolve the issue directly with the company, you may need to seek legal assistance or consider filing a complaint with a consumer protection agency.",

    "ai_text": "A stock's quoted value, also known as its price, represents the current market value of a single share of that stock. It is determined by the supply and demand for the stock in the market, with the price tending to rise as demand for the stock increases and fall as demand decreases.The quoted value of a stock can fluctuate significantly over time and can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the performance of the company, the state of the economy, and investor sentiment. It is important to note that the quoted value of a stock does not necessarily reflect the intrinsic value of the company or the value of the company's assets. It is simply the market's assessment of the stock's worth at a given point in time.",
