The main cause of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These emissions trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to a rise in global temperatures, melting of polar ice caps, and more frequent and severe weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and can affect ecosystems, agriculture, water resources, and human health. It is crucial for individuals, governments, and businesses to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the changing climate."
