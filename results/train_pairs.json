    "human_text": "There is a gland in shellfish that as soon as the animal dies , it starts to make the meat taste very much like ammonia . It does n't take very long at all to ruin a lobster or crab , if it dies before you cook it .",
    "ai_text": "There are a few reasons why some chefs might cook seafood while it is still alive. One reason is that some people believe that cooking seafood while it is still alive can help to preserve the freshness and flavor of the seafood. Some people also believe that cooking seafood while it is still alive can help to preserve the texture of the seafood. However, it is important to note that there is no scientific evidence to support these claims, and many people disagree with the practice of cooking seafood while it is still alive.\r\n\r\nIt is also worth noting that cooking seafood while it is still alive is not a common practice in many parts of the world, and it is generally considered to be inhumane. It is important to handle and prepare seafood in a way that is respectful and humane, and to ensure that the seafood is handled and cooked in a way that is safe and healthy for people to eat. So, it is generally not recommended to cook seafood while it is still alive.",

    "human_text": "You can try . Unless it 's well documented though , you have pretty much no chance of convincing a judge / jury of that -- and even then , you might still be SOL .",
    "ai_text": "It is generally not a good idea to physically fight back against a police officer, even if you believe that the officer is behaving improperly or using excessive force. If you feel that you are in danger and need to protect yourself, it is important to try to get away from the situation if possible and call for help. In some cases, it may be necessary to defend yourself from an attack, but it is important to use only the amount of force that is necessary to protect yourself and to stop the attack. If you are involved in a physical altercation with a police officer, you may end up getting hurt and could also face criminal charges. If you believe that a police officer is behaving improperly or using excessive force, it is important to try to document the incident and report it to the appropriate authorities. There are many resources available to help you do this, including police oversight agencies, civil rights organizations, and legal aid groups.",

They have many different brands of vehicles, such as Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac.The reason GM has so many different brands is because they want to offer a wide range of vehicles to customers. Each brand has a different style and price range, so people can choose the brand that best fits their needs and budget. For example, Chevrolet is known for making more affordable vehicles, while Cadillac is known for making luxury vehicles.Having different brands also allows GM to target specific markets and appeal to different types of customers. Some people may prefer the style and features of a Chevrolet, while others may prefer the luxury and prestige of a Cadillac. By having multiple brands, GM can reach a larger number of customers and sell more vehicles.Overall, GM's approach to using multiple brands allows them to offer a wide range of vehicles to customers and reach a larger market.",

    "human_text": "The ink does n't dry , because the little ball at the tip of the pen provides pretty much an airtight seal . The holes in pen caps are there in case you choked on it - to let air through .",
    "ai_text": "A clicky top pen prevents the pen point from drying out by sealing the pen point when the pen is not in use. When you click the top of the pen to extend the pen point, the pen tip is exposed to the air. When you click the top of the pen again to retract the pen point, the pen tip is sealed inside the pen, which helps to keep it from drying out.\r\n\r\nPen caps are designed to keep pens from drying out and also to prevent the pen from marking your pocket or other surfaces. When the pen point is sealed inside the pen, it is not exposed to the air, which helps to prevent it from drying out. This is especially important for pens that use water-based ink, which can dry out more quickly than other types of ink.\r\n\r\nSo to summarize, a clicky top pen helps to prevent the pen point from drying out by sealing the pen point when the pen is not in use.

    "ai_text": "Sure! Vaccines are special medicines that help our bodies protect us from diseases. When we get a disease, it's because a germ (like a virus or bacteria) has entered our bodies and is making us sick. Our bodies have a special system called the immune system that helps fight off germs and keep us healthy. To make a vaccine, scientists first find a germ that causes a certain disease. Then they make a special version of that germ that is either very weak or has been killed entirely. This special version of the germ is what goes into the vaccine. When we get a vaccine, our bodies think that the special germ in the vaccine is the real thing, so our immune system starts to fight it off. While it's fighting off the fake germ, our immune system also learns how to fight off the real germ. That way, if we ever come into contact with the real germ, our immune system will be ready to fight it off and we won't get sick. So, vaccines help our bodies learn how to protect us from diseases by giving our immune system a chance to practice fighting off germs. They can help keep us healthy and prevent us from getting sick.",

    "question": "Is there a time limit to cover an open short position? [duplicate]",
    "human_text": "There are situations where you can be forced to cover a position, particular when \"Reg SHO\" (\"regulation sho\") is activated. Reg SHO is intended to make naked short sellers cover their position, it is to prevent abusive failure to delivers, where someone goes short without borrowing someone else's shares. Naked shorting isn't a violation of federal securities laws but it becomes an accounting problem when multiple people have claims to the same underlying assets. (I've seen companies that had 120% of their shares sold short, too funny, FWIW the market was correct as the company was worth nothing.) You can be naked short without knowing it. So there can be times when you will be forced to cover. Other people being forced to cover can result in a short squeeze. A risk. The other downside is that you have to pay interest on your borrowings. You also have to pay the dividends to the owner of the shares, if applicable. In shorter time frames these are negligible, but in longer time frames, such as closer to a year or longer, these really add up. Let alone the costs of the market going in the opposite direction, and the commissions.",
    "ai_text": "There is no time limit for covering an open short position. An open short position is created when an investor sells a security that they do not own, with the expectation that the price of the security will fall. The investor can cover the short position by buying back the security at a later date, potentially at a lower price, and returning it to the lender.However, there may be other factors that limit the ability to hold a short position for an extended period of time. For example, some brokers may require investors to maintain a certain level of collateral in their accounts to cover potential losses on short positions. Additionally, some securities may be subject to a buy-in, which is a process by which the lender of the security can force the investor to cover the short position if the security is not returned by a certain date.Overall, it is important for investors to carefully consider their investment strategies and the potential risks and limitations of short selling before opening a short position.",

More \" duds \" are produced that the manufacturer still paid to make , but is unable to sell .",
    "ai_text": "There are a few reasons why the price of TVs tends to increase as the size of the TV gets bigger.\r\n\r\nOne reason is that larger TVs require more materials to manufacture, and the cost of these materials can add up. For example, a larger TV will have a bigger screen, which means it will need more glass or plastic to make the screen. It will also have a bigger body, which means it will need more plastic, metal, or other materials to make the frame. All of these materials cost money, so a larger TV will be more expensive to make.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that larger TVs are usually more advanced and have more features, which can also drive up the price. For example, a larger TV might have a better display, with higher resolution and better color accuracy. It might also have more connectivity options, such as support for streaming services or the ability to connect to other devices wirelessly. All of these additional features can add to the cost of the TV.\r\n\r\nFinally, larger TVs may simply be more in demand, which can cause the price to go up. If more people want to buy a larger TV, manufacturers may be able to charge more for it, because people are willing to pay a higher price to get the TV they want.\r\n\r\nIn summary, there are a few reasons why the price of TVs tends to increase as the size gets bigger.

It focuses on high-quality companies that have prospects for long-term total returns as a result of their ability to grow earnings and their willingness to increase dividends over time Obviously in 1993 quite a few companies paid the dividends and hence VDIGX was able to give dividends. Over the period of years in some years its given more and in some years less. For example the Year 2000 it gave $ 1.26, 1999 it gave $ 1.71 and in 1998 it gave $ 1.87 The current economic conditions are such that companies are not making huge profts and the one's that are making prefer not to distribute dividends and hold on to cash as it would help survive the current economic conditions.

This involves solving one layer of the cube at a time, starting with the top layer and working your way down to the bottom.To solve the top layer of the cube, you need to do the following steps:Hold the cube so that the top face (the face with the white stickers) is facing you.Find a white edge piece (a piece with one white sticker and one sticker of another color).Turn the middle layer so that the empty spot is where the white edge piece needs to go.Hold the cube with the empty spot on the bottom, and turn the top layer so that the white edge piece moves into the empty spot.Turn the middle layer back to where it was.You can repeat these steps until all of the white edge pieces are in the correct place. Then, you can move on to solving the middle layer. To do this, you will need to find a middle layer edge piece (a piece with two stickers of the same color) and place it in the correct spot. You can then solve the bottom layer in a similar way, using the same steps as for the top layer.I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like more information.",

    "question": "If a plane 's wings are what provides lift , how can some fly upside down ? I wasalwaystauggt that a plane 's wings are what provide a planes lift , so how can some planes fly upside down ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "human_text": "Planes need to push air downwards to create an equal and opposite force upwards ( according to something called ' Newton 's third law ' ) . The wings push the air down , so the air pushes the wings up . It 's all to do with something called ' angle of attack ' - the angle that the plane 's wings make with the oncoming air . Have a look [ here ] ( URL_0 ) . A plane with symmetric wings ( like in the picture above ) needs to have a positive angle of attack so the air gets pushed downwards . For it to fly upside - down , it just needs to fly with its nose pointing a little towards the sky in order to create lift in the right direction . Things get a little more complicated with real aircraft - some are curved ( called ' camber ' ) , and some are attached to aircraft with a little bit of positive incidence already . But in the end it 's all down to pushing the air down , which creates an upwards force on the wings . EDIT : attack / incidence",
    "ai_text": "Sure! So planes are able to fly upside down because their wings are shaped in a specific way that allows them to generate lift in all directions. When a plane is flying normally, the shape of the wings helps to push the air down and create an upward force called lift. This lift helps the plane to stay in the air and fly.\n\nBut when a plane is flying upside down, the shape of the wings is still able to push the air down and create lift, even though the plane is upside down. This is because the shape of the wings is designed to create lift no matter which way the plane is pointed.\n\nSo, even though the wings are what provide lift for a plane, they are able to do this no matter which way the plane is oriented. This is why some planes are able to fly upside down.",

Edit : fixed a link",
    "ai_text": "The wings of an airplane are bent at the ends for a few different reasons. First, the bend in the wings helps to make the airplane more aerodynamic, or able to move through the air more efficiently. This is because the bend in the wings creates a curve, or a smooth, rounded shape, which helps the air flow over the wings more smoothly.Another reason why airplane wings are bent at the ends is to give the airplane more lift. Lift is the force that helps an airplane stay up in the air, and it's created by the shape of the wings. When the wings are bent at the ends, it creates more surface area for the air to flow over, which helps to generate more lift.Finally, the bend in the wings also helps to make the airplane more stable in flight. This is because the bend helps to distribute the weight of the airplane more evenly over the wings, which helps to keep the airplane from tipping or rolling too much.Overall, the bend in the wings of an airplane helps to make the airplane more efficient, more stable, and able to stay up in the air.",

    "human_text": "Men and women attempt suicide about equally . The difference in success rate is due to the methods used . Women tend to favour methods that are less certain and more likely to leave an intact body ( pills , cutting wrists . ) There is some thought that this might be due to how women are socialized ( wanting to create the least amount of mess ) . Men on the other hand succeed more because they use more violent methods . ( such as guns or jumping in front of a train ) . Again , here it is thought that socialisation plays a role . Men not only on average have more access to guns / have an interest in guns that is more encouraged , but men also tend to have more of a ' go big or go home ' kind of attitude . Sadly in this case that attitude leads to them dying more . What lays underneath this all is a society where mental health is still too stigmatised and often unaffordable for many people . People are not taught to mind their mental health as they should , and often friends and family members are not aware of the warning signs ( if any are present ) so they find it hard to sound the alarms when things start going south .",
    "ai_text": "Suicide is a complex issue and there is no single answer to why it is more common in males, especially younger males. However, there are several factors that may contribute to this.One possible reason is that males may be more likely to use more lethal means to attempt suicide, such as guns or hanging, which makes it more likely that they will die from their attempt.Another reason could be that males may be more likely to experience certain risk factors for suicide, such as depression, substance abuse, and relationship problems. These risk factors can make it more difficult for males to cope with challenges and stressors in their lives, leading to feelings of hopelessness and a desire to end their lives.It is also possible that societal expectations and cultural norms may play a role in the higher rates of suicide in males. For example, males may be less likely to seek help for mental health problems or to express their emotions, which can make it more difficult for them to get the support and treatment they need.Overall, it is important to recognize that suicide is a serious public health issue that affects people of all genders, ages, and backgrounds. If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide, it is important to seek help as soon as possible.

I interpret this to mean that the order book is primarily market makers. They see a retail investor (me) come in and, since they don't have any interest in this illiquid option, they back off. Some other retail investor (or whatever) steps in with a market order, and we get matched up. I get a fill because I become the market maker for a brief while. On highly liquid options, buy limits at the bid tend to get swallowed because the market makers are working the spread. With very small orders (a contract or two) on very liquid options, I've had luck getting quick fills in the middle of the spread, which I attribute to MM's rebalancing their holdings on the cheap, although sometimes I like to think there's some other anal-retentive like me out there that hates to see such a lopsided book. :) I haven't noticed any particular tendency for this to happen more with puts or calls, or with buy vs sell transactions.

    "ai_text": "When you buy or sell securities, such as stocks, you typically do so through a broker or trading platform. The price at which you can buy a security is called the \"ask\" price, while the price at which you can sell a security is called the \"bid\" price.The difference between the ask and bid prices is called the \"spread,\" and it represents the profit margin for the market maker or broker facilitating the trade.In general, you can buy a security at the ask price or sell it at the bid price. However, it is also possible to purchase a security between the bid and ask prices, or even at the bid price or below, depending on the liquidity of the market and the willingness of buyers and sellers to negotiate.For example, if you are willing to pay a higher price for a security that is in high demand, you may be able to negotiate a purchase price that is above the current bid price.

    "ai_text": "Cats can be trained, but they may not be as eager to please their owners as dogs are. This is because cats have a more independent nature and are not as reliant on human approval and attention as dogs are. They also have a smaller range of vocalizations, which can make it harder for us to understand what they are trying to communicate.However, cats can still learn new behaviors and habits through positive reinforcement, just like dogs. This means that if you reward your cat with treats or praise when they do something you want them to do, they will be more likely to repeat that behavior. It may just take a bit more patience and persistence to train a cat compared to a dog.It's important to keep in mind that every cat is different and some may be more trainable than others.

If you want to invest in individual stocks, you need to look for a bank that offers an IRA/401k/other tax-advantaged account and allows you to invest in individual stocks with it.

It's generally recommended to diversify your investment portfolio by holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, rather than concentrating your investments in a single stock.If you want to use pre-tax money to invest in stocks while also taking advantage of tax benefits, you may want to consider opening a tax-advantaged investment account such as a 401(k) or traditional IRA.

The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and formal languages, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: \"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?\".\nIn order to perform a rigorous study of computation, computer scientists work with a mathematical abstraction of computers called a model of computation. There are several models in use, but the most commonly examined is the Turing machine. Computer scientists study the Turing machine because it is simple to formulate, can be analyzed and used to prove results, and because it represents what many consider the most powerful possible \"reasonable\" model of computation (see Church\u2013Turing thesis). It might seem that the potentially infinite memory capacity is an unrealizable attribute, but any decidable problem solved by a Turing machine will always require only a finite amount of memory. So in principle, any problem that can be solved (decided) by a Turing machine can be solved by a computer that has a finite amount of memory.",

When the pressure at the sea floor is 3 1/2 tons per square inch, the force is applied evenly across the entire surface of the ship's hull, which is designed to withstand that level of pressure.\r\n\r\nThink of it like a balloon. If you blow up a balloon, the air pressure inside the balloon increases, but the balloon doesn't burst because the rubber is flexible and can stretch to accommodate the increased pressure. Similarly, the steel hull of the Titanic was able to stretch and bend slightly under the pressure of the water, without breaking or collapsing.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Titanic was designed with a series of compartments that were separated by watertight doors. These compartments were meant to help keep the ship afloat even if one or more of them were damaged or flooded.

    "question": "Credit or Debit ? Should I care ? I am asked every time and I just say either . Should I care ? Is one better for me than the other when they both go to my bank account ? Explain like I'm five.",
    "human_text": "If you are buying any product , such as airline tickets , where you believe there is any possibility you may develop a dispute later , make sure to use credit not debit , as your ability to dispute is increased . Large or fragile purchases - credit is required . A hamburger that you will eat in the next five minutes - debit is okay . I speak from recent personal experience that debit card disputes are hell . I had to spend 7 months of my life going to small claims court after the debit bank 's dispute policy was so ineffective and produced no refund . ( I won in court ) .",
    "ai_text": "When you use a credit card, you are borrowing money from the credit card company to make a purchase. You will need to pay back the borrowed amount, plus any interest, at a later date. On the other hand, when you use a debit card, the money is being taken directly from your bank account to make the purchase.\r\n\r\nIn general, it is a good idea to care about whether you are using a credit card or a debit card, because using credit cards responsibly can help you build a good credit score, which can be useful in the future when you want to borrow money for a big purchase, like a house or a car. On the other hand, if you use a credit card irresponsibly and don't pay your balance in full every month, you could end up with a high amount of debt and a low credit score, which could make it difficult for you to borrow money in the future.\r\n\r\nSo, to summarize, if you are able to use a credit card responsibly and pay off your balance in full every month, it can be a good option for you. However, if you are not able to do this, it might be better for you to stick with a debit card, which allows you to only spend the money you have available in your bank account.",

    "ai_text": "When light travels from one medium to another, its speed can change because the properties of the two media, such as their density and refractive index, can be different. When the speed of light changes, the direction of the light ray can also change. This is because the light ray will bend, or refract, as it passes through the boundary between the two media. Imagine that you are walking through a field and come to a fence. When you reach the fence, you might have to change direction to follow it. Similarly, when light encounters a boundary between two media, it might have to change direction to follow the boundary. The amount that the light ray bends depends on the angle at which it hits the boundary and the difference in the refractive indices of the two media. When the refractive index is higher in the second medium, the light ray will bend towards the normal (a line perpendicular to the boundary). When the refractive index is lower in the second medium, the light ray will bend away from the normal. I hope this helps to explain why the direction of the light ray can change when it travels from one medium to another. Let me know if you have any more questions!",

    "ai_text": "Hot water actually doesn't make better ice cubes. The key to making good ice cubes is using clean, filtered water and allowing the ice to freeze slowly in the freezer.\n\nWhen you use hot water to make ice cubes, the hot water can cause the ice cube tray to expand, which can cause the ice cubes to come out misshapen. Additionally, hot water will melt some of the ice as it freezes, which can result in cloudy, opaque ice cubes.\n\nOn the other hand, if you use room temperature or cold water and allow the ice cubes to freeze slowly in the freezer, the water will freeze more evenly and the ice cubes will come out clear and solid.\n\nSo, the best way to make good ice cubes is to use cold or room temperature water and be patient while the ice freezes.

    "ai_text": "There are a few reasons why you might want to consider replacing your box spring when you replace your mattress. \nFirst, the box spring provides support for your mattress. It helps to evenly distribute the weight of your body and the mattress across the bed frame. If the box spring is worn out or damaged, it may not be able to provide the necessary support for your new mattress. This could cause the mattress to wear out more quickly or be less comfortable to sleep on. \nSecond, a new box spring can help to extend the life of your new mattress. When you sleep on a mattress, it naturally compresses and expands. Over time, this can cause the mattress to become uneven or sag in certain areas. A new box spring can help to prevent this by providing a more stable surface for the mattress to rest on. This can help the mattress to maintain its shape and support for longer. \nFinally, if you are upgrading to a new mattress with different features or a different level of firmness, you may want to consider a new box spring to match. Different types of box springs may be better suited to certain types of mattresses. For example, a firmer box spring may be more suitable for a softer mattress, while a softer box spring may be better for a firmer mattress. \nIn summary, replacing your box spring when you replace your mattress can help to provide the necessary support and stability for the mattress, extend its lifespan, and ensure that it is as comfortable as possible.",

The Babylonians used a base 60 number system, and they divided the day into 24 hours, each hour into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds. One reason for using base 60 is that it can be evenly divided by many numbers, which makes it very convenient for measuring time. For example, 60 can be evenly divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30. This made it easy for the Babylonians to divide the day into smaller units of time. Another reason for using base 60 is that it is a highly composite number, which means it has a lot of factors. This makes it easy to express fractions of an hour in a simple and accurate way. For example, 15 minutes is equal to 1/4 of an hour, and 45 minutes is equal to 3/4 of an hour.

    "question": "Is investing in financial markets a gamble? ",
    "human_text": "I read about the 90-90-90 rule aka 90% of the people lose 90% of the money in 90 days.  Anything that happens in 90 days or less is speculation (effectively gambling), not investment. And the 90-90-90 thing sounds around right for inexperienced amateurs going up against professionals in that space. I don't know anyone who actually made significant amount money by investing in stocks or other financial products except those appearing in TVs. Lots and lots and lots of people do.  I heard that people who actually encourage common people to invest in stocks are stock brokers and fund managers who actually gain by the fact that more people invest.  No. It's true that lots of people will give you advice to by specific stocks or financial instruments that will earn them comission or fees, but the basic idea of investing in the stock market is very sound; ultimately, it's based on the ability of companies to create value and pay dividends. Could you please give some valid reasons to invest in stocks or other financial market. Thank you. Well, what else can you do with your money? Put it in an interest-bearing bank account? Effectively, you'll still be investing in the stock market, the bank is just taking most of the returns in exchange for guaranteeing that you'll never lose money even temporarily.",
    "ai_text": "Investing in financial markets carries some level of risk, but it is not the same as gambling. When you invest in financial markets, you are making an informed decision based on research and analysis with the goal of earning a return on your investment. Gambling, on the other hand, is the act of risking money or other assets on an uncertain event with the hope of winning a prize. The outcome of gambling is largely determined by chance, whereas the outcome of investing is based on a combination of market conditions, the performance of the investment, and the investor's ability to make informed decisions.It's important to understand that all investments carry some level of risk, and it is not possible to eliminate risk entirely. However, by diversifying your portfolio and investing for the long term, you can manage risk and potentially maximize your returns. It is always a good idea to carefully consider your investment goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation before making any investment decisions.",

I don't generally hold individual stocks long, but I do buy options when I think there are price moves that aren't supported by the fundamentals of a stock. All of this riskier short-term investing is done in my Roth IRA, because I want to maximize the profits in the account that won't ever be taxed. I wouldn't want a particularly fruitful investing year to bite me with short term capital gains on my income tax. I usually beat the market in that account, but not by much. It would be pretty easy to wipe out those gains on a particularly bad year if I was investing in the actual stocks and not just using options. Many people who deal in individual stocks hedge with put options, but this is only cost effective at strike prices that represent losses of 20% or more and it eats away the gains. Other people or try to add to their gains by selling covered call options figuring that they're happy to sell with a large upward move, but if that upward move doesn't happen you still get the gains from the options you've sold.",

Keep an eye on the news and be sure to read any public statements or announcements from the company, the activists, and any regulatory bodies.Engage with management: If you are concerned about activist targeting of your stock, consider engaging with the company's management team. You could reach out to them directly or attend shareholder meetings to voice your concerns and ask questions.Consult with a financial advisor: If you are unsure about how to proceed, consider consulting with a financial advisor or professional. They can help you understand the situation and advise you on the best course of action.Consider selling your stock: If you are particularly concerned about the risk associated with activist targeting, you may decide to sell your stock.

    "human_text": "There is technically a physical limit to the information that could be possibly stored in that space , but practically speaking of course , no a person could not actually ' fill ' their brain .",
    "ai_text": "The human brain is an amazing organ that is capable of storing a vast amount of information. In fact, it is estimated that the brain has the capacity to store an almost unlimited amount of information, with some estimates suggesting that it could hold around 2.5 petabytes of data. That's a lot of information! Now, it's important to note that the brain doesn't store information in the same way that a computer does. Instead of using hard drives or other physical storage devices, the brain stores information in the connections between neurons (nerve cells). These connections, called synapses, allow neurons to communicate with one another and transmit information throughout the brain. So, while it is theoretically possible for the brain to store an almost unlimited amount of information, it is not a simple matter of just \"filling up\" the brain with more and more data. Instead, the brain's ability to store and process information depends on the strength and efficiency of these connections between neurons. When we learn new things, we are actually strengthening and creating new connections between neurons, which allows us to store and recall more information. In short, while the brain has an incredible capacity for storing and processing information, it is not a simple matter of just filling it up with more and more data.

He came to power in Germany in 1933, after the country had been through a difficult time following World War I and the Great Depression.\r\n\r\nOne reason Hitler was able to come to power was because he was a very good speaker and could persuade people to follow him. He used propaganda, which is information that is not necessarily true, but is spread to help a particular cause or idea. Hitler and his supporters spread propaganda through newspapers, radio, and huge public speeches. They also used symbols, like the swastika, to help make their ideas more memorable.\r\n\r\nAnother reason Hitler came to power was because the German people were looking for someone to blame for their problems. Hitler blamed Jews and other minority groups for Germany's problems, and many people believed him. This made it easier for him to win support from the German people.\r\n\r\nFinally, Hitler came to power because the German government at the time was not very strong and there was a lot of unrest in the country.

The limiting factors are the strength of the material comprising the mountain to resist deformation , versus the force gravity exerts on the mass of the mountain . As it grows , the weight of the mountain eventually deforms the material underneath it . This is essentially why large bodies like planets are spheres , instead of wacky shapes extending into space .",
    "ai_text": "Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, with a peak that reaches an elevation of about 29,029 feet (8,848 meters) above sea level. It is not actually growing in height, but rather, it is being uplifted by the movement of the Earth's crust. This process is called tectonic uplift, and it occurs when the Earth's plates collide and push against each other. \nAs for whether the peak of Mount Everest could eventually reach space, the answer is no. The Earth's atmosphere extends about 62 miles (100 kilometers) above the surface of the Earth, and the peak of Mount Everest is much shorter than that. Even if Mount Everest were to continue to be uplifted at a rate of two inches per year, it would take many thousands of years for it to reach the edge of the atmosphere. \nThere are also other factors that limit the height that a mountain can reach. For example, the weight of the mountain itself can cause it to sink down into the Earth's crust. Additionally, erosion caused by wind and water can gradually wear away at the mountain, causing it to become shorter over time. \nSo, to sum it up, Mount Everest is not going to grow tall enough to reach space. It is being uplifted by the movement of the Earth's plates, but there are other factors that limit its height and prevent it from growing indefinitely.",

Other people have hair that is more straight or wavy because their hair shafts have a more round shape, which makes the hair less likely to curl.

    "ai_text": "The letter \"e\" is a mathematical constant that represents the base of the natural logarithm. It is a very important number in mathematics and appears in many different areas of study, including calculus and statistics.\n\nThe natural logarithm is a special type of logarithm that is used to solve problems involving exponential growth and decay. It is denoted by the symbol \"ln\" and is defined as the inverse function of the exponentiation with base e. This means that if you take the natural logarithm of a number, you are essentially undoing the exponentiation that was done to get that number.\n\nFor example, if you have the equation \"y = e^x,\" then taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives you \"ln(y) = x.\" This can be useful for solving equations or simplifying expressions involving exponential functions.\n\nTo explain this concept to a five-year-old, you could say that the letter \"e\" is like a magic number that helps us understand how things grow or shrink really fast. It helps us figure out how long it will take for something to double, triple, or even grow a hundred times bigger.",

    "ai_text": "Very spicy food can burn your mouth and anus because those areas have a lot of nerve endings, which are sensitive to spicy substances. The spicy substance in the food activates these nerve endings and can cause a burning sensation. The burn might not be felt all the way through because the spicy substance might not come into contact with all the nerve endings in your body. Additionally, the strength of the burn can vary depending on how sensitive your nerve endings are and how much of the spicy substance you have consumed. Does that make sense?",

For example, if a politician is offered money to vote a certain way on a bill, that would be bribery.\r\n\r\nLobbying, on the other hand, is legal and involves trying to influence a politician or government official by providing them with information or arguing a certain point of view. Lobbying can be done by individuals, groups, or organizations, and it is often done to try to shape laws and policies in a way that will benefit the lobbyist or the group they represent.\r\n\r\nSo, the main difference between bribery and lobbying is that bribery involves giving something of value in exchange for an illegal action or inaction, while lobbying is a legal way of trying to influence politicians and government officials through the use of information and argument.",

When you sleep, your body goes through different stages of sleep, including deep sleep and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. These stages are important for your physical and mental health, and they help you feel rested and refreshed when you wake up. When you oversleep, you may disrupt these stages and throw off your body's natural sleep-wake cycle, which can lead to feelings of fatigue. It's also possible that oversleeping may be a sign of an underlying health issue, such as a sleep disorder or depression, which can also contribute to feelings of fatigue.

During a performance, the conductor will usually have a copy of the music that the orchestra is playing.

Graham also believed that smaller companies may have less transparency and may be more prone to manipulation, making it more difficult for investors to accurately assess their value.Graham's minimum size criterion was just one of many factors that he recommended investors consider when evaluating potential investments.

However, if you add up all of the pieces that you gave away, you get 0.99 + 0.99 + 0.99 + ..., which is equal to 1.\n\nSo, 0.99 repeating is equal to 1 because, even though it's not exactly 1, when you add up an infinite number of pieces that are each very close to 1, the total is equal to 1. Does that make sense?",

    "human_text": "A rather good IRS paper on the topic states that a donation of a business' in-kind inventory would be  Under IRC 170(e)(1), however, the fair market value must be   reduced by the amount of gain that would not be long-term capital gain if the   property had been sold by the donor at the property's fair market value (determined   at the time of the contribution). Under this rule, deductions for donated inventory   are limited to the property's basis (generally its cost), where the fair market value   exceeds the basis.  There are references to IRC regulations in a narrative context you may find helpful: This paper goes on for 16 pages describing detailed exceptions and the political reasons for the exceptions (most of which are concerned with encouraging the donation of prepared food from restaurants/caterers to hunger charities by guaranteeing a value for something that would otherwise be trashed valueless); and a worked out example of fur coats that had a cost of goods of $200 and a market value of $1000.",

This may require some extra effort and planning.Taxes: As a self-employed individual, you will need to pay self-employment taxes in addition to your regular income taxes. It's important to keep track of your self-employment income and expenses so you can accurately report them on your tax return.Legal considerations: Depending on your full-time job and the nature of your self-employment, there may be legal considerations to take into account. For example, you may need to get permission from your employer if your self-employment could be seen as a conflict of interest.Personal considerations: It can be challenging to balance the demands of a full-time job and self-employment, so it's important to consider your own energy levels and priorities before taking on both.Overall, it's possible to be self-employed while also working a full-time job, but it requires careful planning and time management to make it work.",

    "human_text": "Well , they used to have higher instances of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome , too . When a baby is sleeping on the stomach , the chest is compressed between the mattress and spine , giving less ability to inhale ( this happens in adults , too , but we can adjust ourselves ) , the neck can end up compressed as the head tries to get into a comfortable position , and the mouth and nose can end up covered by the bedding . All of these can combine together to increase the risk of mortality in babies , who have less ability and strength to get out of a deadly situation . Laying the baby on the back allows free movement of the diaphragm , the head falls back to better open airways , and the mouth and nose are less likely to become obstructed .",

When babies sleep on their stomachs, they may be at an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is a rare but serious condition that can cause a baby to stop breathing during sleep. Babies who sleep on their backs are less likely to experience SIDS because the position helps to reduce the risk of the baby's airway becoming blocked.\\n\\nIt used to be common for babies to sleep on their stomachs, but doctors and researchers have learned more about SIDS and how to reduce the risk of it occurring. Now, it is recommended that all babies sleep on their backs to reduce the risk of SIDS as much as possible.\\n\\nSo, to make sure your baby is safe and healthy, it is important to follow the current recommendations and have your baby sleep on their back.

The human immune system is responsible for protecting the body against infection and disease by identifying and eliminating foreign substances, such as bacteria and viruses. An artificial immune system is designed to perform similar functions, such as detecting and responding to threats in a computer system, network, or other type of artificial environment.\n\n\n\nArtificial immune systems use algorithms and machine learning techniques to recognize patterns and anomalies in data that may indicate the presence of a threat or vulnerability. They can be used to detect and respond to a wide range of threats, including viruses, malware, and cyber attacks.\n\n\n\nOne of the main advantages of artificial immune systems is that they can operate continuously, monitoring the system for threats and responding to them in real-time. This allows them to provide ongoing protection against threats, even when the system is not actively being used.\n\n\n\nThere are many different approaches to designing and implementing artificial immune systems, and they can be used in a variety of different settings, including in cybersecurity, medical diagnosis, and other areas where detecting and responding to threats is important.",

That s assuming you could get it to eat the food , and the digestive system does n't outright reject the meat .",
    "ai_text": "Herbivore animals, such as goats, are adapted to eat plants, not meat. If a herbivore animal is fed a diet that is high in meat, it can cause digestive problems and may lead to malnutrition. This is because the animal's digestive system is not designed to break down and process meat in the same way that a carnivore's digestive system is. Meat is also much higher in fat and protein than plants, which can lead to an imbalance in the animal's nutrition. When an herbivore animal eats a lot of meat, it can lead to indigestion and other digestive problems, such as constipation or diarrhea. The animal may also experience weight gain, as meat is much more calorie-dense than plants. Over time, a diet that is high in meat can cause serious health problems, such as organ damage, and may even be fatal. It is important to feed herbivore animals a diet that is appropriate for their digestive system and nutritional needs. This typically includes a variety of plants, such as hay, grass, and vegetables. Providing a balanced diet will help the animal stay healthy and happy.",

    "question": "How does the wash sale rule work in this situation?",
    "human_text": "The way the wash sale works is your loss is added to your cost basis of the buy.  So suppose your original cost basis is $10,000.  You then sell the stock for $9,000 which accounts for your $1,000 loss.  You then buy the stock again, say for $8,500,  and sell it for $9,000.  Since your loss of $1,000 is added to your cost basis, you actually still have a net loss of $500. You then buy the stock again for say $10,500,  then sell it for $9,500.  Your $500 loss is added to your cost basis,  and you have a net loss of $1,500. Since you never had a net gain, you will not owe any tax for these transactions.",
    "ai_text": "The wash sale rule is a tax rule that applies when you sell a security at a loss, and then within 30 days before or after the sale you either buy the same security or an \"substantially identical\" one. If the wash sale rule applies, you cannot claim the loss on your tax return. Instead, the loss is added to the cost basis of the new security, which means that the loss is deferred until you sell the new security.For example, suppose you own 100 shares of XYZ stock, which you bought for $1,000. You sell the stock for $500, realizing a loss of $500. A few days later, you buy 100 shares of XYZ stock for $600. In this case, the wash sale rule would apply, and you would not be able to claim the $500 loss on your tax return. Instead, the loss would be added to the cost basis of the new shares, which means that your cost basis in the new shares would be $1,100 ($600 purchase price + $500 deferred loss). If you later sell the new shares for $1,000, you would have a $100 capital loss ($1,100 cost basis - $1,000 sale price).",

    "human_text": "The first question to answer is , what is the point of sleep ? Among some other functions , the primary purpose of sleep is for the brain to enter into a maintenance mode . Think of it as that 2 am hard drive defragging that runs when you would n't otherwise be on your computer . Instead of space reallocation , however , the brain 's process is biochemical and serves to \" wash and replenish \" the brain 's cellular machinery , something that ca n't happen when the individual is in a waking state . This process is both reactive ( meaning it does n't do any good to do it before there 's a mess to clean ) and rate limited ( which means that it takes X amount of time to achieve Y results ) . As such , the normal waking / sleeping cycle maintains an equilibrium of building up a mess and cleaning it up . You ca n't bank sleep . That would be similar to cleaning an already clean house for the sake of cleaning it and expecting any mess that you make in the future to come out of the extra work you did . It just does n't work like that .",
    "ai_text": "Sleep debt is the difference between the amount of sleep you actually get and the amount of sleep you need. When you don't get enough sleep, your body builds up a \"sleep debt.\"\\n\\nSleeping for 24 hours can help you catch up on some of your sleep debt, but it's not a good idea to try to skip the next 3 days of sleep. Our bodies need a certain amount of sleep every day to function properly, and missing out on that sleep can have negative effects on your health and well-being.\\n\\nWhen you sleep, your body goes through different stages of sleep. During these stages, your body is working to repair and restore itself, and it's also helping to consolidate your memories and process the information you learned during the day. Skipping sleep can make it hard for your body to do these important things, and it can make you feel tired, cranky, and less able to focus.\\n\\nSo, while it might be tempting to try to catch up on sleep by sleeping for a long time and then skipping a few days of sleep, it's not a healthy way to manage your sleep. Instead, try to get a consistent amount of sleep every night to help your body and mind stay healthy and alert.",

Fur on animals is typically the same as body hair on humans , though some animals -- dogs and cats -- go through rhythmic periods of hair loss called shedding .",
    "ai_text": "Hair on different parts of the body grows at different rates and stops growing at different lengths because of genetics, hormones, and other factors. Hair on the head and facial hair tends to grow longer because the hair follicles in these areas are programmed to produce longer, thicker hair. On the other hand, hair in certain areas like the armpits and pubic region tends to be finer and grows to a shorter length because the hair follicles in these areas are programmed to produce shorter, finer hair. As for animal fur, it also grows at different rates and lengths depending on the animal and the location of the fur on its body. For example, a lion's mane may grow longer than the fur on its legs because the hair follicles in the mane area are programmed to produce longer, thicker fur.

In addition, modern cruise ships are built with lots of safety features, like watertight compartments, that help them stay afloat even if they take on water. This means that in many cases, the ship won't sink, and people can simply wait for it to be towed to a safe place. Finally, lifeboats can be big and heavy, and they take up a lot of space.

Compounding that effect with the dividend effect on equity prices, reducing their prices, the future should suffer more.",
    "ai_text": "When a company declares a dividend on its underlying stock, the price of the stock typically decreases by an amount equal to the dividend on the ex-dividend date, which is the date on which the stock begins trading without the dividend. This is because the dividend is paid out of the company's profits, and the value of the company's profits is reflected in the stock price.The price of a security futures contract is derived from the price of the underlying stock, so the dividend will also affect the price of the security futures contract. The value of the security futures contract is based on the value of the underlying stock minus the value of the dividend that will be paid out. Therefore, when the stock goes ex-dividend, the price of the security futures contract will typically decrease by an amount equal to the dividend.It's important to note that the effect of a dividend on the price of a security futures contract can be more complex than this simple explanation, as other factors such as supply and demand, market conditions, and the current level of interest rates can also affect the price of the contract.",

It can be resource-intensive: Some users have reported that Norton can be quite demanding on a computer's resources, which can slow down the performance of other programs or even the entire system. 2. It can be overprotective: Some users have also reported that Norton can be overly aggressive in blocking certain actions or programs, which can be frustrating if you are trying to do something legitimate. 3. It can be expensive: Depending on the specific product and subscription plan you choose, Norton AntiVirus can be more expensive than some other antivirus software options on the market. Overall, Norton AntiVirus is designed to help protect your computer from viruses and other types of malware. While it can be effective at doing this, it may also have some drawbacks that some users find annoying or inconvenient.

This misinformation can come from a variety of sources, including the internet, social media, or people they know who may not have accurate information about vaccines.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that some people might be afraid of vaccines because they don't understand how they work or what they do.

This allows books to be organized in a way that is similar to how they are organized in other countries that use the Roman alphabet, such as the United States or the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nPinyin works by representing each Chinese character with a combination of letters from the Roman alphabet. For example, the character for \"book\" is written as \"shu\" in pinyin. When books are sorted using pinyin, they are arranged in alphabetical order based on the pinyin spelling of the title.\r\n\r\nSo, if you were looking for a book in a Chinese library, you would start by looking in the section that corresponds to the first letter of the pinyin spelling of the book's title. For example, if you were looking for a book with the pinyin title \"Xue,\" you would start by looking in the section labeled \"X.\" Then, you would look for the specific book within that section based on the rest of the pinyin spelling of the title.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!

The rash is often found in areas where the mites like to burrow, such as the folds of the skin, between the fingers and toes, and on the wrists, elbows, and buttocks.\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with scabies and have been prescribed an antibiotic cream, it is important to follow the instructions for use and continue using the cream until the infestation has been fully treated. It is also important to clean and treat any clothing, bedding, or other items that may have come into contact with the mites.\n\nAs for your low body temperature and feeling cold, these could be symptoms of a number of different conditions. It is possible that you are experiencing these symptoms due to a side effect of your medication or due to an underlying health condition.

Learning the multiplication tables up to 15 or 20 would require memorizing more facts, which might be more challenging for some people.

    "human_text": "An aeroplane wing creates lift as it moves through the air . It moves through the air because the aeroplane is moving forward . In a helicopter , the \" wings \" , aka rotor blades , are moved through the air by virtue of the fact that they rotate . Other than this , they create lift in the same way as an aeroplane wing . A complicated system of pulleys adjusts the angles of each of the blades as they rotate , depending on which portion of their rotation they are on . The pilot adjusts this system to make the helicopter go where he wants . For example , by making the blade have a higher angle when it 's at the rear of the helicopter , you get more lift on the rear part of the rotor than the front part , which makes the whole rotor ( and helicopter ) point nose - down , meaning that some of the lift from the rotor goes forward rather than up , and the helicopter accelerates . Of course , Newton tells us that when the rotor blade rotates one way , the helicopter has to rotate the other way . There are various ways of stopping this from happening - the most common of which is to have a tail - rotor , whose job is to create just enough sideways force at the rear of the helicopter to prevent the helicopter spinning round and round ( although the pilot can control the tail - rotor to make the helicopter turn , or * yaw * , in a more controlled manner ! )",
    "ai_text": "Sure! A helicopter is a type of aircraft that is able to lift off the ground and fly by using rotors on top of it. These rotors are large, spinning blades that create lift, which is the force that holds the helicopter up in the air.\n\nTo understand how a helicopter is able to fly, it's helpful to think about the four forces of flight: lift, weight, thrust, and drag.\n\nLift: As the rotors on a helicopter spin, they create lift, which is what holds the helicopter up in the air. The shape of the blades and the way they are tilted helps to create lift.\n\nWeight: Every object on Earth is pulled downward by gravity, and a helicopter is no exception. The weight of the helicopter is what is being balanced by the lift.\n\nThrust: The engines on a helicopter provide the thrust, or forward motion, that allows it to move through the air.\n\nDrag: Drag is the force that slows an object down as it moves through the air. A helicopter has to overcome drag in order to stay in the air and move forward.\n\nSo, to stay in the air, a helicopter has to create enough lift to balance out its weight and overcome drag.
