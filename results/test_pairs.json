    "ai_text": "The snow in the video you linked is not actually burning, but rather it is undergoing a process called sublimation. Sublimation is the transition of a substance from a solid directly to a gas, without passing through the liquid phase. When a substance undergoes sublimation, it skips the melting process and goes straight from a solid to a gas.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the snow in the video, the snow is being exposed to a very high heat source, such as a flame or a hot surface, which causes it to sublimate. As the snow sublimates, it may give off a smell similar to that of burning or chemicals. This is because the heat is causing the molecules in the snow to break down and release gases, which can have a strong or unusual smell.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that sublimation is a normal and natural process, and it is not the same as burning. Burning is a chemical reaction that occurs when a substance combines with oxygen and produces heat, light, and smoke. The snow in the video is not burning, but rather it is undergoing sublimation due to the high heat.",

    "human_text": "2x4 is the \" nominal \" size and refers to the rough cut / \" green \" board and you can actually by them that way . After they are dried they are planed for a smoother finish and this gives you the slightly smaller size of 1 - 1/2 \" x 3 - 1/2 \"",
    "ai_text": "When lumber is cut from a tree, it is typically rough-cut, meaning it still has the bark and outer layers of the tree on it. These layers are removed during the planing process, which smooths out the wood and gives it a uniform thickness. The planing process also removes some of the wood from the surface of the board, which is why a 2x4 is not actually 2 inches by 4 inches when it is first cut.After the rough-cut lumber is planed, it is dried in a kiln to reduce the moisture content. As the wood dries, it shrinks slightly, which can also cause the board to become smaller in size.So, when you see a piece of lumber labeled as a 2x4, it means that it was originally cut to be 2 inches by 4 inches, but it has been planed and dried, which has caused it to be slightly smaller than those dimensions.",

So , even if a military member has already been tried for a crime by a civilian court , they can still be prosecuted for the exact same crime by a military court . The UCMJ does not exist to allow soldiers to break foreign laws or exempt them from civilian laws . There are Rules of Engagement ( ROE ) and Status of Forces Agreements ( SOFA ) that outline specifically exactly what a military member may or may not do for every country they operate in . The UCMJ and the military justice system is an extra line of punitive measures to ensure that military are held to military standards .",

If someone breaks a rule in the military, they can be punished through the military's justice system. Crimes that are committed by military members can also be tried in civilian courts, depending on the circumstances. For example, if a military member commits a crime while they are off duty and not on a military base, they can be tried in a civilian court. However, if the crime was committed while the military member was on duty or on a military base, it may be handled by the military's justice system. Overall, the military's justice system is in place to help maintain discipline and order within the military, and to ensure that members of the military are held accountable for their actions.",

However, if your goal is to build equity in the property and potentially sell it in the future, paying off the mortgage may be a good idea as it will increase your equity in the property.Ultimately, the decision to pay off an investment property mortgage will depend on your individual financial situation and investment goals.

SVD is often used for dimensionality reduction and data compression.\n\n\n\nEigenvalue Decomposition (EVD): EVD decomposes a matrix into two matrices: D and V, where D is a diagonal matrix and V is a unitary matrix. EVD is often used to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix, which can be used to analyze the behavior of linear systems.\n\n\n\nQR Decomposition: QR decomposition decomposes a matrix into two matrices: Q and R, where Q is a unitary matrix and R is an upper triangular matrix. QR decomposition is often used to solve systems of linear equations and compute the least squares solution to a linear system.\n\n\n\nCholesky Decomposition: Cholesky decomposition decomposes a matrix into two matrices: L and L^T, where L is a lower triangular matrix and L^T is its transpose. Cholesky decomposition is often used to solve systems of linear equations and to compute the determinant of a matrix.\n\n\n\nMatrix decomposition can be a useful tool in many areas of science, engineering, and data analysis, as it allows matrices to be manipulated and analyzed more easily.",

It is calculated by dividing the expected net operating income (NOI) of a property by its purchase price or current market value. The NOI is the income the property is expected to generate after operating expenses have been paid, but before debt service (e.g., mortgage payments) and taxes have been deducted.The cap rate is often used to compare the potential returns of different real estate investments. It can be useful for evaluating the relative risk and potential for appreciation of different properties. A property with a higher cap rate may be considered a better investment because it has a higher expected return on the investment. However, it's important to note that the cap rate should not be the only factor considered when evaluating a real estate investment. Other factors such as location, condition of the property, and future market trends should also be taken into account.",

    "ai_text": "A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a company's profits to its shareholders. Dividends are typically paid in cash, but they can also be paid in the form of additional shares of the company's stock. Dividends are usually paid out on a regular basis, such as quarterly or annually.When a company pays dividends, it can affect your position in the company in a few ways. If you own shares of the company's stock, you will typically receive a dividend payment for each share you own. This can provide you with a source of income and can potentially increase your return on investment in the stock.However, if you own shares in a company that is paying dividends, the value of the stock may decrease by an amount roughly equal to the value of the dividends paid. This is because the company is using some of its profits to pay dividends, rather than using those profits to reinvest in the business or using them to pay down debt.Overall, whether dividends are a positive or negative for your position in a company will depend on your investment goals and your overall financial situation. Some investors may value the steady stream of income provided by dividends, while others may prefer to see the company use its profits to grow the business and potentially increase the value of the stock over time.",

It tells you how much a line goes up or down as you move to the right.\n\nImagine you are standing at the bottom of a hill and you want to know how steep the hill is. You could measure the slope of the hill by finding the difference in height between two points on the hill and then dividing that number by the distance between those two points. A steep hill would have a bigger slope than a shallow hill.\n\nSlope is important because it can tell you a lot of things about the relationship between two things. For example, if you are studying how the price of a product changes over time, you could make a graph with the price on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis. The slope of the line on that graph would tell you how much the price changes for each unit of time. If the slope is steep, the price is changing a lot over time. If the slope is shallow, the price is not changing much over time.\n\nSlope is also important in math and science because it can help you understand and solve problems. For example, if you know the slope of a hill, you can figure out how much energy it would take to roll a ball down the hill or how fast a car would go if it drove down the hill.

If the string is wet or damp, it may mean that the tampon is full and needs to be changed.\r\n\r\nThe tampon is difficult to remove: If a woman has trouble removing the tampon or feels resistance when trying to pull it out, it may be time to change it.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember to change tampons every 4 to 6 hours, even if the flow is light. This will help prevent the risk of TSS, which is a rare but serious condition that can be caused by leaving a tampon in for too long.",

In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that laetrile is not safe or effective for treating cancer or any other disease. The FDA has banned the sale of laetrile in the United States because it is not a safe or effective treatment for cancer. The agency has also issued warnings about the dangers of using laetrile, including the risk of serious side effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, and even death. In short, laetrile was banned by the FDA because it has not been shown to be safe or effective for treating cancer, and there is a risk of serious side effects associated with its use.",

    "question": "Why do men get tired after ejaculating ? Just wondering . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_text": "After men ejacluate , prolactin is released . This is a hormone linked to feelings of sexual satisfaction and also causes sleepiness and drowsiness .",
    "ai_text": "Ejaculating, or \"coming,\" is the process of releasing semen from the body. Semen is a fluid that contains sperm, which are tiny cells that can fertilize a female's egg and create a baby. When a man ejaculates, his body goes through a series of physical responses that can make him feel tired afterwards. One reason a man might feel tired after ejaculating is because the muscles in his body have been working hard. During ejaculation, the muscles in the prostate, pelvis, and lower back all contract to help push the semen out of the body. These contractions can be intense and may cause a man to feel a bit tired or weak afterwards. Another reason a man might feel tired after ejaculating is because of the chemicals that are released in the brain during the process. Ejaculation can cause the brain to release chemicals like oxytocin and prolactin, which can make a person feel relaxed and drowsy. Finally, ejaculating can also be physically and mentally exhausting, especially if it has been a while since the last time a man ejaculated. It's not uncommon for men to feel a bit tired after ejaculating, especially if they have been sexually active for an extended period of time. I hope this helps to explain why men might feel tired after ejaculating. Is there anything else I can help with?",

    "ai_text": "Although planets like Mars may seem small compared to the vastness of outer space, they are still relatively large objects, and spacecrafts are able to use the laws of physics to calculate their paths and trajectories with a high degree of accuracy. \nWhen a spacecraft is launched, it is given a specific speed and direction, and it follows a predictable path through the solar system based on the gravitational pull of the sun and other celestial objects. This path can be calculated and planned well in advance using computers and advanced mathematical models. \nHowever, it is important to note that there are many factors that can cause a spacecraft to deviate from its planned trajectory, such as unexpected gravitational forces, solar flares, and technical malfunctions. Despite these challenges, spacecrafts are able to use onboard propulsion systems and other technologies to make course corrections and stay on track. \nOverall, while it is not uncommon for spacecrafts to encounter minor deviations from their planned paths, they are generally able to reach their intended destinations with a high degree of accuracy thanks to the advanced planning and technology that goes into their missions.",

Sports analysts and experts will look at all of this information and use it to make predictions about the team's chances of winning. They might also consider things like home-field advantage and whether the team has any particularly difficult stretches of games coming up.Once they have all of this information, they can use it to create a mathematical model that will help them to predict the team's chances of winning. This might involve analyzing data from previous seasons, running simulations, or using other techniques to try to get a sense of how likely it is that the team will win.Finally, the odds to win are usually expressed as a ratio, with the first number representing the number of times the team is expected to lose, and the second number representing the number of times they are expected to win. So, for example, if the odds to win are 3:1, it means that the team is expected to lose three times for every one time they are expected to win.",

    "ai_text": "Admitting that you are wrong can be difficult for a number of reasons. Here are a few potential explanations: 1. Pride: People may be reluctant to admit they are wrong because they don't want to feel embarrassed or ashamed. They may be worried about what other people will think of them if they admit they were mistaken. 2. Ego: People may be unwilling to admit they are wrong because they don't want to feel like they are not as smart or competent as they thought they were. Admitting that you were wrong can feel like a blow to your ego or self-esteem. 3. Personal identity: People may be resistant to admitting they are wrong because it feels like it challenges their personal identity or sense of self. People often define themselves in part by their beliefs, and admitting that you were wrong about something can feel like you are admitting that a part of your identity is not correct. 4. Fear of change: Admitting that you are wrong may also mean that you have to change your beliefs or actions, which can be difficult or scary for some people. There have been many studies on why people have a hard time admitting they are wrong. Some research suggests that it may be related to the brain's natural tendency to avoid cognitive dissonance, or the discomfort that comes from holding two conflicting beliefs at the same time.

    "ai_text": "Eating in moderation helps because it can help you maintain a healthy weight. When you eat more food than your body needs, your body stores the extra calories as fat. If you eat too much fat over a long period of time, you may gain weight and become overweight or obese.

On the other hand, if you eat the right amount of food for your body's needs, you can maintain a healthy weight. This means that you are not consuming too many calories and not storing excess fat in your body. It is also important to eat a variety of different foods in moderation, rather than eating too much of any one type of food.

    "question": "Why to high performance engines like drag cars and hot rods have engines that sound like they are out of sync at an idle ? I have a pretty good understanding of basic engine operation but this has always baffled me . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_text": "They use really big cams that do not make power until a certain high RPM , its called the power band . At low RPMs the cam is n't working efficiently . Most drag car cam 's power band might be from 3000RPMs to 7000Rpms . Drag cars , right before the green light will raise their RPMS to the power band which is where the cam is designed to run",
    "ai_text": "Great question! There are a few reasons why high performance engines might sound like they are out of sync at idle. One reason is that the engine might have a lot of horsepower, which means it can generate a lot of power. This can make the engine shake or vibrate more than a normal engine, which can cause it to sound out of sync. Another reason is that high performance engines are often built with parts that are designed to be very lightweight. This can help the engine go faster, but it also means that the parts are more sensitive to vibrations. This can cause the engine to sound out of sync, especially at idle. Finally, some high performance engines have very high compression ratios, which means that the air and fuel in the engine are squeezed very tightly together. This can also cause the engine to vibrate more and sound out of sync at idle. I hope that helps! Is there anything else you would like to know about engines?",

    "ai_text": "High yield bond prices can be attractive to investors because they offer the potential for higher returns than bonds with lower yields. However, there is a reason that these bonds offer higher yields: they also carry higher risks.Bonds with higher yields are often issued by companies that have weaker credit ratings, which means that there is a greater risk that the issuer will default on its debt payments. As a result, investors in high yield bonds need to be willing to accept a higher level of risk in exchange for the potential for higher returns.In addition, high yield bonds can be more vulnerable to changes in market conditions and investor sentiment. For example, if interest rates rise, the value of high yield bonds may decline, because investors will be able to get higher yields on safer, higher-quality bonds. Similarly, if investors become more risk-averse, they may sell off high yield bonds, leading to price declines.In summary, while high yield bonds may offer the potential for higher returns, they also carry higher risks that investors need to be aware of before investing in them.",

Flameless ration heaters (FRHs) are small packets that can be used to heat up MREs and other food items without the need for an open flame or electricity. Here's how they work: 1. The FRH consists of a small pouch filled with a mixture of iron, water, salt, and an oxidizing agent (like potassium chloride). 2. When the pouch is opened and the water is added, the iron reacts with the water and salt to produce iron oxide (also known as rust). 3. The rust then reacts with the oxidizing agent, producing heat as a byproduct. 4. The heat is transferred to the MRE or other food item, which warms it up. So, in summary, the FRH uses a chemical reaction between iron, water, salt, and an oxidizing agent to produce heat, which is then used to warm up the food. It's a simple, convenient way to heat up food without the need for a stove or other cooking equipment.",

Maybe you could n't make something huge out of it -- but someone else certainly did . It 's similar here . For plants , it 's not * just * soil and water . There are nutrients in there ; there are sugars and other things the plants can get from the soil . And the plants that are known to make toxins take these building blocks and rebuild them to become toxins . Think of yourself as a human . You just eat normal food ; how do you get things working on a cellular level ? How do your sodium - potassium pumps work ; how do your cells split all the time ? It 's because we can break up the food we eat and get nutrients out of them - carbohydrates , proteins , fat , and so on . Humans may not have the right mechanics in our cells to produce toxins , but other plants and animals do .",
    "ai_text": "Plants and animals don't create poison out of nothing, they produce it using the resources they have available to them. For example, some plants produce poison as a way to protect themselves from being eaten by animals. These poisons are usually made using chemicals that the plant absorbs from the soil and water it takes in.\\n\\nAnimals can also produce poison, but they usually do it as a way to defend themselves or to catch food. For example, some frogs produce poison on their skin as a way to protect themselves from predators. These poisons are made using chemicals that the frog absorbs from the food it eats.\\n\\nIt's important to note that not all plants and animals produce poison, and the poison that is produced is usually not enough to kill a whole village with just a single drop. In fact, most poison is not very potent at all and can only cause mild discomfort or illness. Some poison, however, can be very potent and even deadly if a person or animal is exposed to a large enough amount.\\n\\nSo, in short, plants and animals produce poison using the resources they have available to them, and the poison can vary in potency from mild to deadly.",

    "human_text": "Short version : evolution and natural selective pressures do n't care that we 've figured out how to do blood transfusions .",
    "ai_text": "Different blood types exist because of the presence or absence of certain proteins, called antigens, on the surface of red blood cells. There are two main antigens that determine blood type: A and B. There is also a protein called the Rh factor, which can be either present (+) or absent (-). Your blood type is determined by which antigens and Rh factor you have. For example, if you have A antigens and the Rh factor, your blood type is A+. If you have B antigens and no Rh factor, your blood type is B-. The different blood types are important because they determine what types of blood can be safely given to a person. For example, if someone with type A+ blood receives type B- blood, their body may react negatively and try to attack the foreign blood. This can lead to serious health problems or even death. That's why it's important to know your blood type and to make sure that blood transfusions are carefully matched.",

Good question , sadly I 'm not a zoologist . Humans , however , are considered omnivores . Like pigs . And they smell really bad ~~(pun intended)~~. But their ability to smell is good . See comment below . EDIT : Think of predatory birds .",
    "ai_text": "The human sense of smell is not necessarily \"bad\" compared to other animals, but it is not as finely tuned as the sense of smell of some other species. This is because the part of the human brain responsible for processing smells (the olfactory bulb) is not as well developed as in animals that rely more heavily on their sense of smell to find food, avoid predators, and communicate with each other. \nThere are many other carnivores (meat-eating animals) that have a much stronger sense of smell than humans. For example, dogs and bears have a highly developed sense of smell that they use to locate food, detect the presence of other animals, and communicate with each other. Some animals, such as snakes, use their sense of smell to locate prey, while others, such as lions and tigers, use it to hunt and locate other animals. \nSo, while the human sense of smell may not be as strong as some other animals, it still serves important functions, such as helping us detect and avoid rotten or spoiled food, and helping us recognize and differentiate between different odors.",

    "human_text": "Decibels are a logarithmic unit . They take a ratio and output a value . One property of logarithms is that for ratios less than 1 , the value of the expression is negative . The \" loudness \" of a noise that is 0 dB is not in fact silent . It is an arbitrarily chosen reference point that does n't actually relate to anything in nature . \" Silence \" , or the complete absence of all sound , would in fact be negative infinity decibels . Therefore , negative decibel readings mean that the volume of the sound is less than our arbitrarily chosen reference point , not that it is somehow \" negative sound \" . You should think of negative decibel sounds as extremely super incredibly quiet sounds , because what a decibel reading does is n't measure absolute volume but compare it to our reference point . Positive readings are louder than our \" standard sound level \" and negative readings are softer .",
    "ai_text": "Decibels (dB) are a unit of measurement used to describe the loudness or intensity of a sound. The decibel scale is logarithmic, which means that a small change in decibel level corresponds to a much larger change in the actual loudness or intensity of the sound.\n\nThe quietest place on earth is an anechoic chamber, a room designed to be completely soundproof and to absorb all sound waves that enter it. These chambers are often used to test the acoustic properties of products or to conduct experiments that require a completely quiet environment.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to have a sound level in the negative decibels, it is possible to measure sound levels that are very close to zero decibels. This is because the decibel scale is logarithmic, and a small change in decibel level corresponds to a much larger change in the actual loudness or intensity of the sound.\n\nFor example, a sound level of 0 dB represents the threshold of human hearing, which is the faintest sound that a person can hear. A sound level of -10 dB is 10 times quieter than a sound level of 0 dB, and a sound level of -20 dB is 100 times quieter than a sound level of 0 dB.\n\nSo, even though it is not possible to have a sound level in the negative decibels, it is possible to measure very quiet sounds that are close to zero decibels.",

If you were to muffle a real 150db gunshot down to 85db , it would n't even sound like a gun shot . So in Hollywood , they have to basically engineer a sound that is believable .",
    "ai_text": "In movies, sound effects are often added or enhanced in post-production to make the film more exciting or dramatic. The actual sound of a gun firing may not be loud or intense enough on its own, so the sound designers will add other elements to make the gun sounds more impactful. They might also use sounds from different types of guns or mix in other sounds like explosions or metal clanging to create the desired effect. In real life, gun sounds can vary depending on the type of gun, the type of ammunition being used, and the environment the gun is fired in.

If you are too tired to drive safely, you should pull over and find a safe place to rest. 2.
