idea:
  title: Is there a 'sounds like AI' direction in the residual stream?
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Large language models exhibit linear structure in their residual streams
    that controls output style and semantics. This research asks whether there exists
    a specific direction in the residual stream that corresponds to outputs that "sound
    like AI".

    '
  background:
    description: LLMs are known to have a lot of linear structure that controls their
      output styles and semantics. Is sounding like an AI one of those?
